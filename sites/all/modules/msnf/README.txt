-- SUMMARY --

"Multistep Nodeform" is a modul to split up node forms into single steps.

For each step you can define which fields should be included in this step.
"Fields" includes core-fields like "Title", "Body" or "Authoring information"
as well as fields defined by the <a href="drupal.org/project/cck">Content Construction Kit</a>.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

None.


-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual.
See http://drupal.org/node/70151 for more information about how to install a
module.


-- CONFIGURATION --

To split up a node form into steps you have to create the steps for each
content type to split. Go to the content type administration (Administer >>
Content >> Types) and click "edit" for the desired content type.
Now you can manage the steps and the field association on the "Manage steps" tab.
After adding a tab you can drag it to the position you like and move fields into
the step.

Note: if you use fieldgroups (a field type installed by CCK) you can't put
core-fields ("Title", "Body", "Authoring information", etc., ) under fieldgroups
as this is not supported (not by CCK, nor by this module).
You are able to visually move the fields under the group but this setting won't
be saved.


-- EXPORT --

By using the great <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a>
module you can export each step into code.


-- TRANSLATION --

To translate strings used in "Multistep Nodeform" (such as step title,
description or button labels) you need to install i18n
(http://drupal.org/project/i18n) and its sub-module "String translation".
